# MCIC Presentation Notes

## Introduction

Paulo Borem, MD has extensive experience with large-scale healthcare improvement interventions in Brazil, Portugal and multi-nation projects in Africa. He will apply his experience to a new project with 11 EDs in Sao Paulo Brazil. The ED project will launch before the end of 2024. Paulo and his colleagues have deployed management systems to increase the odds that improvements will be sustained over time. He will share his experience and insights with us today.

### The ED environment

The ED care environment is characterized by a fast pace and diversity of patient conditions. In 2024, most emergency departments in the U.S. also face high demands for service. High daily demand increases the challenges for safety, effectiveness and efficiency. How can ED leaders continue to improve performance in this environment?

While the ED environment differs in important ways from other clinical settings, changes that have shown promise in other settings may work in your ED, with appropriate adaptation. The presentation today will invite your questions and perspectives to explore a set of changes to management of clinical operations that we believe are relevant to EDs.

## Our common experience with improvement projects

Have you experienced an improvement project that failed? There are many ways a project might fail. Some projects never get off the ground or an initial great idea that worked in someone else's ED doesn't deliver improvement in local tests where you practice.

Let's focus on projects that showed promise initially but could not be sustained over time.

![](images/Improvement%20Question%201.png){width="500"}

What's your story?

We have had many projects just like yours.

Some of our failure modes include:

-   The "new way" was too difficult to maintain, with too much burden for staff

-   We didn't address problems that emerged in dynamic clinical settings

-   Staff turnover diluted knowledge and skills; training and on-boarding did not provide new staff with the skills and knowledge they needed

-   Other initiatives and priorities demanded attention and effort, we lost focus

-   We proposed changes that the front-line staff don't think matters.

How can we prevent these failure modes? We'll present what Paulo has learned over the past five years.

## A look at the ICU Project 2018-2021--A "failure"?

Paulo helped to design and lead a large-scale project to reduce hospital-acquired infections in 118 public hospital ICU units in Brazil. Over two years, the project achieved more than a 50% reduction in HAI averaged across the ICU units. The main intervention deployed specific infection prevention "bundles."

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide5.PNG){width="500"}

However, this project had a fundamental weakness. The method to achieve the lower HAI rates depended on a burdensome feedback cycle. After 12 months, almost all ICU units had stopped collecting data on adherence to the use of the care bundles that formed the foundation of the project.

The Ministry of Health in Brazil wanted to have more ICUs reduce infection rates. However, it seemed likely that initial good results would fade if the ICUs did not have a method to sustain use of the bundles through effective feedback.

The Ministry of Health asked for a change in methods to address this fundamental issue.

Paulo and his project colleagues embarked on a journey to explore different and novel ways to address sustainability of their interventions.

Prompted by the Ministry of Health's criticism, Paulo and his colleagues next designed and deployed a project to improve maternal mortality and morbidity, focused on interventions in Emergency Departments.

He extended the design used in the Maternal Mortality project in new projects that aimed to reduce infections in ICUs in Brazil and in ICUs and wards in Portugal.

The three new projects allowed him to test new ways to improve operations and sustain those improvements. We'll refer to these projects as we tell you about the management system that Paulo now proposes for his clients.

## Paulo's new approach is based on two mind shifts

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide6.PNG){width="500"}

Paulo has shifted from the way he worked in 2019. He now develops and deploys large-scale improvement projects with two design principles:

-   Quality Improvement requires Quality Control

-   Problems are good to have

### Quality Improvement must integrate with Quality Control

What's your experience in understanding the connection between Quality Improvement and Quality Control?

Paulo now firmly believes that Quality Improvement must be integrated with Quality Control to increase the odds that improvements will stick. If an organization does not have an effective system of Quality Control, you have to build a QC system as part of an improvement project. As Joseph Juran observed, Quality Control is not inspection of results and repair or fixing after the product or service is complete. Quality Control happens during operations

The relationship between Quality Control and Quality Improvement may not be news to you.

Different quality experts have stressed QI and QC integration for decades but we didn't understand the implications as deeply as we do now.

For example, here's a diagram based on a sketch in 1991 by Dr. Noriaki Kano, an expert in Japanese Total Quality Control (the diagram appears in the [IHI White Paper, "Sustaining Improvement."](https://www.ihi.org/resources/white-papers/sustaining-improvement#downloads)

![](images/imageKano.png){.img-border width="500"}

In the diagram, Quality Control is the beginning and end of Quality Improvement. Quality Control itself is a cycle that starts with Standard Work.

"Standard work is a verb and not a noun....Standard work is meant to be a hypothesis to test the results of everyone doing something in the same way all the time....Standard work, therefore, is not the destination itself but simply a *tool* along the way in our endless quest to find the best, safest, and easiest way to deliver patient care." (*Getting to Standard Work in Health Care*, 2nd edition, p. 27).

Sustaining Quality Improvement requires a foundation in standard work. The foundation of standard work is the work standard: for each care process, what are the jobs and how should those jobs be done?

Paulo's experience with the Maternal Mortality Project opened the door to better ways to define and teach jobs through clear work standards.

### Problems are good to have

The Kano diagram shows that Quality Control generates problems.

Here's our definition of problem: a problem is simply a gap between between what you want and what you've got right now. A solution to a problem closes or eliminates the gap.

We now believe that your challenge and ours is to build management systems that make it easy for people to find and solve problems. That's a radical shift from seeking a management system that has no problems.

The more problems, the better!

Of course, too many problems will overwhelm the best organization. You must catch the problems before the problems are too big and your people need sufficient skills and support to solve the problems they find.

#### "No problems is the biggest problem of all."

We've looked for a citation to this observation attributed to Taiichi Ohno, developer of the Toyota Production System. We haven't found a precise reference to this advice but we like the provocation.

How can you modify your existing management system to make problems more visible and ready for your people to solve?

The second phase of Paulo's ICU Improvement Project used several methods to make problems more visible, including a way to contrast the plan for core work with what people actually do, in real-time.

#### Quality Control builds your capacity for Quality Improvement

In carrying out Quality Control during operations, people use the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle explicitly every day. Daily experience with PDSA builds skills of supervisors and individuals as they solve problems connected with daily work. Daily work problems often have simpler causal relationships than typical organization or department improvement projects, which makes the daily problems easier to solve.

When your organization needs a special improvement project and your people use PDSA problem-solving as part of Quality Control, you will have a large cadre of skilled people who can contribute to the special project. Your special improvement project will not rely solely on staff specialists who often do not have detailed job-specific knowledge and know-how to develop solutions that will work well.

## Improving performance of 11 EDs in Sao Paulo, Brazil: 4th Quarter 2024

Paulo and his colleagues are designing a learning community that aims to improve care in 11 EDs. Leaders in the 11 EDs will clarify several elements of care as they define standard work. The leaders in the EDs will also make it much easier to see and solve operational problems.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide8.PNG){width="500"}

![](images/ED%20Project%20aims.png){width="500"}

Here's a summary of the management system being designed for the ED project to solve the problems and achieve the aims. This management system has emerged from experience in three large-scale improvement projects starting in 2019.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide10.PNG){width="500"}

You are likely to be familiar with and may be using one or more of the management practices in your EDs right now.

We borrowed the term "Amplify problems" from Kim and Spear (2023), *Wiring the Winning Organization*. Kim and Spear describe a management system that makes it easy for staff and leaders to find and perceive problems. One pillar of their system is amplification.

"*Amplifcation* is the act of calling out problems loudly and consistently enough so help is triggered to swarm them. Once the problems are swarmed, they are contained so they neither endure locally nor spread systemically. Then, they are investigated to determine their causes and create corrective actions that prevent recurrence. This requires that the signal of a problem is successfully generated, transmitted, received, and then reacted to." (Kim and Spear, p. 233).

### Lessons from the Maternal Mortality Project 2019-2021, changing care in the ED

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide12.PNG){width="500"}

The Maternal Mortality Project focused on reducing birth-associated mortality in hospitals (mostly ED sites of care). The project was the first project Paulo and his colleagues led that integrated the technique of Job Instruction with a core clinical process.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide13.PNG){width="500"}

![](images/MM-2.png){width="500"}

![](images/MM-3.png){width="500"}

#### Quick look at results of the project through 2021

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide15.PNG){width="500"}

The MMP project team identified a high-leverage process, "4Rs to Rescue." High leverage means that a small amount of change effort appeared likely to cause a large change in maternal mortality.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide16.PNG){width="500"}

To achieve the clear aim (work standard) for care of pregnant women, the project team developed specific bundles of care used to rescue.

To reduce variation in the way staff carried out the bundles, the project team applied a new way, "Job Instruction" to train staff in the key steps within each of the 4R process blocks. Here's the rescue bundle for suspicion of sepsis.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide17.PNG){width="500"}

#### Job Instruction

Job Instruction (JI) is one of the core methods in the Training Within Industry (TWI). We give a bit more information about TWI in the section [Teach skills to do the work (JI Method)](#teach-skills-to-do-the-work-ji-method)).

JI requires one-to-one teaching. This is a striking difference from methods that lecture or demonstrate to groups.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide18.PNG){width="500"}

The instructor uses a Job Breakdown Sheet to guide the 1-1 training demonstration and explanation. The instructor uses the same teaching approach outlined 80 years ago.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide19.PNG){width="500"}

The instructor shows the important steps, then repeats the demonstration stating the key points and reasons for the key points. Next, the instructor observes the person do the job, with corrections as necessary. The person learning the job next demonstrates the important steps while repeating back the key points and reasons. When the instructor is satisfied that the person knows the important steps, key points and reasons, the person is ready to go to work.

**What did Paulo's teams learn from their use of the JI method? What are the benefits?**

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide20.PNG){width="500"}

Everyone has clarity about the core jobs. Common agreement on core jobs provides the basis for future adjustments and upgrades to work.

New people can learn the important steps along with key points. The key points give how-to tips so new people carry out the work in the same way as current staff, reducing variation. People know why they are doing specific tasks a certain way. Knowing why helps to cement the sequence of steps and key points.

While 1-1 training may seem inefficient, ultimately there is no other way we've seen that delivers the consistency of job performance produced by JI method.

JI supports a Training Plan: who will know what and by when. We do not expect every person to master every job skill all at once. Supervisors and managers can organize a sequence for training. The training achievement of team members allows more effective schedules to assure sufficient people with skills are present on each shift across shifts, accounting for vacations and leaves of absence. The training status naturally appears as a chart on the local visual management board.

Paulo's experience: People resist the systematic way of training at the beginning. When they understand the impact, they will adopt it.

### Lessons from HAI reduction projects, 2021-present: make problems easy to see (and solve)

Paulo and his colleagues continued to apply the Job Instruction methods in two more projects that aimed to reduce hospital acquired infections. The project designers adapted bundles of care for HAIs first developed in the ICU Phase 1 Project. One project involved 200 ICUs in Brazil; the other project involved 20 public hospitals in Portugal ICUs and wards.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide21.PNG){width="500"}

The projects achieved their aims. Here is a summary slide for the Brazil ICU project:

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide22.PNG){width="500"}

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide23.PNG){width="500"}

The HAI projects involved several elements of the management system that will be used in the ED Project.

-   Huddles: ICUs and wards adapted shift huddles to include reflection on problems related to the HAI project the previous day and asked for any additional problems. The stand-up huddles were coached not to solve the problems but only to capture the problem statements.

-   Problem Identification: The ICUs and wards introduced a way to invite and gather problems from the entire team. Anyone who identified a problem would describe it briefly and deposit into an envelope hanging on the management board. These problems as well as problems identified in huddles were reviewed once a week and assigned for solution by local project leaders.

-   Management Boards: Each site of care built a daily management display board that contained graphs of key metrics, problem-solving status, and audit records of work. Huddles took place in front of the board to make it easy for people to discuss and identify issues.

We'll say more about work observations because we think is the most novel aspect of our recent projects.

#### Work Observations: the Kamishibai method

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide24.PNG){width="500"}

After people are trained in basic job skills using Job Instruction, how well are they able to carry out the jobs according to the standard?

The Kamishibai method is a way to link the job skills defined by Job Breakdown Sheets with a regular audit of work. Observers must be trained to compare the work with the work standard. If there is a safety issue, the observer must stop their colleague and fix the problem. If there are other deviations from the standard that are not safety issues, the observer notes the problem and debriefs with their colleague at the end of the observation.

The team takes the results from regular audits to build a picture of performance. A display board enables everyone to see the state of compliance with the core work skills in the clinical unit, week by week. Adherence to the standard is rated as pass (Green) or fail (Red).

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide25.PNG){width="500"}

The person who observed the work places the completed card on a summary display. The summary display has a column for each day of the week and a row for each bundle element. The card is placed in the relevant cell of the display.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide26.PNG){width="500"}

Each clinical unit usually summarizes weekly performance in a time series chart, one graph per bundle so that the history of previous weeks is not lost.

Here's a view of the improvement in compliance for the VAP prevention bundle (HAI project in Brazil). Results for the other infection bundles were similar.

![](images/ICU%20Phase%202%20VAP%20element%20reliability.png){width="500"}

**Automation innovation** An innovation is now planned for a first test in a multi-country project in Africa that started earlier this month: use AI tools to reduce manual effort to translate weekly Kamishibai records into a run chart or control chart. A photo of the Kamishibai board will be taken at the end of each week and then run through an application to count the red and green cards in the photo, The app then converts the counts to a control chart. The team will post the chart on the management board. The project in Africa is also testing ways to use AI tools to process language data into summaries.

**What did Paulo's teams learn from their use of the Kamishibai method? What are the benefits?**

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide27.PNG){width="500"}

The Kamishibai method takes effort to establish. The main challenge is getting the clinical unit members comfortable and persistent in daily work observation and the red-green scoring.

Remember that in the ICU Phase 1 project, ICU teams used bundle-compliance checklists that were summarized and reviewed monthly. This was the feedback system that collapsed after the first year.

Kamishibai increases the velocity of the action/response cycle to deviations from the desired bundle practice. A monthly cycle in the ICU Phase 1 project is now a daily cycle. This 30-fold increase in review cycle frequency means that problems in jobs are caught much earlier and have less chance to result in an infection. Every day, at least some staff members explicitly compare job performance with the desired state and catch deviations. In many other applications of the Kamishibai method, a supervisor or other formal leader audits the work. In the HAI projects, most of the audits are done by peers, which increases job awareness throughout the team.

The Kamishibai board shows everyone the state of job performance on key elements of care. Problems with the elements of the bundles became annoyingly visible. The red cards on the wall are out in the open for anyone to see. In Paulo's experience, local leaders work hard to reduce red cards.

As indicated by the slide, the project designers and teams found the method suited their collaborative projects. They found very little variation among hospitals about the definition of compliance to each element of the bundle. Low variation makes it simpler to aggregate numbers across settings to assess overall impact. Also, the cost of construction of the display board and cards was modest.

**Question for the audience: how can the Kamishibai method work an ED environment?**

Here's the schematic of a Kamishibai board for the new ED project.

![](images/MASTER DECK/Slide29.PNG){width="500"}The ED project in Brazil will focus on patients who present with seven conditions: respiratory distress, stroke, cardiac infarcts, sepsis, trauma, abdominal pain and heart congestion failure.

The project team plans to develop Job Breakdown Sheets to cover the steps of the generic rescue process, including the specific rescue bundles for each condition.

What challenges and countermeasures do you see in application of the Kamishibai method in the ED environment?

# Additional notes on elements of the management system

## Agree on the work

Agreement on the details of specific jobs that produce products and services is the foundation of quality control.

How do you characterize the desired outcomes embodied by your products or services?

The definition of quality gets translated into sets of instructions your organization will use to produce the outcomes:

-   the characteristics of the product or service you intend to produce;

-   the conditions of equipment and the environment that support production;

-   the step by step operations by people to make everything happen.

The instructions are referred to as work standards, which are the foundation of standard work defined above.

The Quality Control cycle during operations requires that we set up operations in two ways:

(1) make it easy to see any differences when you contrast the outcomes and process of actual operations with the work standards and

(2) catch and reduce differences by corrective actions.

Isao Kato, a key associate of Taiichi Ohno at Toyota starting in the 1950's, summarized the essence of Quality Control in his "Step-ups" Model.

![](images/Step-ups-1.png)

In Kato's model:

-   Step up 1 defines Normal--what you expect, in the sense of a 'Norm'.

-   Step up 2: Make it easy to see the difference between Normal and Abnormal. Step up 2 enables you to see problems!

-   Step Up 3: Problem solve (reduce the gap) between Normal and Abnormal.

-   Step up 4: Refine the workflow to drive out waste and develop skills of people.

-   Step up 5: Assure the continued health of the first four step ups.

Step ups 1-3 are the core activities of standard work. Step up 4 and Step up 5 merge with the elements of the overall management of operations. See <https://www.iecodesign.com/blog/2021/1/13/work-standard-and-standard-work> for further discussion.

Here's an illustration of work standards from the ICU project, Phase 2 (VAP = ventilator acquired pneuomonia)

![](images/Work5.PNG){width="500"}

## Teach skills to do the work (JI Method) {#teach-skills-to-do-the-work-ji-method}

Job Instruction is one of part of the Training Within Industry curriculum.

![](images/TWI-1.png){width="500"}

TWI was invented and developed through dozens of test cycles 1940-1945 by the United States War Manpower Commission. TWI's development is a great example of iterative refinement, PDSA in action.

The Commission created and refined three 10-hour courses to help supervisors work with their people to increase production and safety:

1.  Job Instruction: How to do a job correctly and safely (JI)
2.  Job Methods: Basic industrial engineering (JM)
3.  Job Relations: The human side of supervision (JR)

The Commission also created a course for trainers, Program Development.

TWI was introduced to Japanese engineers and managers as part of the U.S. occupation of Japan after 1945.

"\[The\] Japanese Labor Ministry still controls the use of TWI by administering programs and licensing other organizations to conduct the 'J'courses." (Dinero, p. 47)

Toyota leaders incorporated TWI into the nascent Toyota Production System in the 1950's.

Here are images of the World War II era pocket cards for JM and JR, to complement the pocket card for JI we showed earlier.

![](images/TWI-3.png){width="500"}

![](images/TWI-2.png){width="500"}

### Adapting Job Instruction in the Maternal Mortality and ICU projects

The War Manpower Commission developed Job Instruction for war-time factories. A supervisor could build the Job Breakdown Sheet and teach a job skill on the production floor or using a special workstation with producton tools and materials. In jobs that involve direct patient care, Paulo's teams adapted the original approach. For example, in the 10-hour "learn how to teach the JI way" class , 14 supervisors used mannequins and simulated care settings to learn how to create Job Breakdown Sheets and teach using the Job Instruction outline.

The project team then held weekly sessions with these supervisors to co-design all the Job Breakdown Sheets for each element of the bundles. These Job Breakdown Sheets were again created using simulation care settings and then refined based on direct clinical application to patients.

![](images/JI%20simulation%20training.png){width="500"}

## Amplify problems

### Huddles

### Gemba Walks

Pay attention to process (flow)--the value stream. How are local leaders managing flow? What issues have the local team escalated to others and what is the degree of responsiveness? Pay attention to the quality control system: how well do huddles run? How effective is the use of the Kamishibai method? How are people solving problems? Are skills in PDSA and structured problem solving deepening?

### Kamishibai method

![](images/Kamishibai%20definition.png){width="500"}

![](images/K-board%20full%20schematic%20and%20photos.png){width="500"}

The image above is from Bravo et al. (2023), which describes how the ICU Phase 2 project team developed and deployed Kamishibai boards in almost 200 hospitals.

### Individual problem reporting

The ICU projects developed a problem report form that anyone can use. The staff person fills out the form and puts it in a folder on the management display board. Problems are reviewed weekly (see next section.)

![](images/Problem%20Report%20Sheet.png){width="500"}

## Assign and solve problems

Problem-solving is not an occasional activity in Quality Control. In Paulo's current design, unit teams use a weekly cycle of problem dentification and assignment. Problems are divided into See and Solve problems and Structured Problem Solving problems. Structured Problem Solving requires the logic and documentation using an [A3 problem-solving template](https://www.iecodesign.com/blog/2019/10/29/a3-problem-solving-and-the-model-for-improvement).

Each week the RN and MD leads for the project have a 20 minute meeting. Typically, one front-line representative attends, too. Other people may be invited (e.g. pharmacist). \[LINK TO VIDEO?\]

Here's the typical agenda for the problem review session:

1.  how many new problems have we gotten since last week?
2.  Sort the problems in a 2 x 2 Importance x Difficulty matrix.
3.  Decide See and Solve or A3 approach for each problem.
4.  Update the Daily Management Board, that shows projects and the help chain, end date and status.

![](images/Problem-solving%20intro%202.PNG){width="500"}

The unit leaders decide how many improvement mini-projects can be "open" at any one time. A limit on the number of projects reinforces the message that it is important to finish a mini-project before adding a new one to the board. In the recent collaboratives most units are able to address between two and five problems at any one time.

**Key points:**

-   See and Solve reminds you to Go See and catch the problem in action before determining a solution.

-   if the same See and Solve problem recurs more than a few times, then this problem is escalated to A3 problem-solving. The recurring problem deserves more analysis and deeper countermeasures.

## Make performance visible: use an analog display board

Why not just keep everything about your unit's performance in the computer?

Paulo says: "The system needs to speak to you." A computer is not accessible to everyone on-demand in a clinical unit. You need to log in, find the right place to look among many options...people give up! When the display is on the wall, you can't escape everyone sees the same thing.

There are applications of digital displays for bed management that may work well. An analog display does not depend on the IT service team to revise format or update content. No waiting in the IT project queue!

In Paulo's experience, the benefits outweigh the \~10 minutes a dayrequired to keep the analog board up-to-date.

During the collaborative, the collaborative leader has the job to keep the board updated. After the formal end of the collaborative, the unit leader has the job.

## Tips for improving a management system

1.  Take the usual advice in change management: Test on a small scale. E.g. take one bundle related to one condition in the ED project. Develop the Job Breakdown Sheets, determine how Kamishibai method could work with the initial bundle. Don't ask staff to develop Job Breakdown Sheets and begin instructing for all conditions and all bundle elements. Testing on a small scale builds confidence and know how for your people and reduces risks of failure. Table 7.1?

Link to "Model Cell" language. Kim and Spear theory.

2.  Embrace simulations (refer to Kim and Spear, too.) You Tube video McDonald simulation.

## What about Juran's notion of Quality Planning?

If you are familiar with Joseph Juran's Quality Trilogy, Quality Planning complements Quality Improvement and Quality Control.

![](images/WSQ%20Juran%20Trilogy.png){width="500"}

Quality Planning is the way an organization identifies areas of opportunity and change related to strategy and markets. . Quality Planning is not reacting to immediate operational problems. Quality Planning addresses design of new products and services and the translation of the design into production through initial experiments and pilot-scale operations.

You see that the Kano diagram does not show a role for Quality Planning. For example, the diagram does not show a path of improvement projects that emerge from Quality Planning rather projects as responses to operational problems.

While we don't address Quality Planning today, we believe that Quality Planning must rest on understanding the health and performance of operations and on an effective Quality Control system.

[Example:]{.underline} The rapid pivot in 2020 to COVID protocols in clinical settings is an example of an exogenous change that drove changes to operations. Healthcare organizations with robust QC systems adapted quickly and more safely relative to other organizations.

## Sources of influence

Our thinking and consultation practice has several major influences. You may be familiar with one or more of the following. We think the least familiar to most people is the Training Within Industry (TWI) approach to front-line operations.

-   Deming through API and IHI (Model for Improvement, System of Profound Knowledge);

-   Juran (Juran Trilogy, the definition of self-control);

-   Lean approach to design and deployment of production systems (various authors list) and advice on specific elements of operations management;

-   Training Within Industry skills for supervisors and management.
